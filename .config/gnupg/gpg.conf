#-----------------------------
# default key
#-----------------------------

# The default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is
# the first key found in the secret keyring

# default-key 0x18F3685C0022BFF3

# trusted-key 0x18F3685C0022BFF3

#-----------------------------
# behavior
#-----------------------------

# Disable inclusion of the version string in ASCII armored output
no-emit-version

# Disable comment string in clear text signatures and ASCII armored messages
no-comments

# Display long hexidecimal key IDs format
keyid-format 0xlong

# List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints
with-fingerprint
with-subkey-fingerprint

# Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key listings
list-options show-uid-validity
verify-options show-uid-validity

# Show expired subkeys
# list-options show-unusable-subkeys

# Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to
# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.
use-agent

# This silences the "you need a passphrase" message once the passphrase handling is all set.
# Use at your own discretion - may prevent the successful interactive use of some operations.
# It is working fine for my use cases though.
# batch

# Ensures the cross certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and
# valid. This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
require-cross-certification

# UTF-8 support for compatibility
charset utf-8

# Show Unix timestamps
fixed-list-mode

# Disable caching of passphrase for symmetrical ops
# no-symkey-cache

# keyserver
#-----------------------------

# This is the server that --recv-keys, --send-keys, and --search-keys will
# communicate with to receive keys from, send keys to, and search for keys on
# keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
# https://github.com/mozilla/sops/issues/727
# https://gist.github.com/rjhansen/67ab921ffb4084c865b3618d6955275f

# Provide a certificate store to override the system default
# Get this from https://sks-keyservers.net/sks-keyservers.netCA.pem
#keyserver-options ca-cert-file=/usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net.pem

# Set the proxy to use for HTTP and HKP keyservers - default to the standard
# local Tor socks proxy
# It is encouraged to use Tor for improved anonymity. Preferrably use either a
# dedicated SOCKSPort for GnuPG and/or enable IsolateDestPort and
# IsolateDestAddr
#
# I run my tor socks proxy in a container, see .dockerfunc and
# github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles
#keyserver-options http-proxy=socks5-hostname://torproxy:9050

# Don't leak DNS, see https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/2846
#keyserver-options no-try-dns-srv

# When using --refresh-keys, if the key in question has a preferred keyserver
# URL, then disable use of that preferred keyserver to refresh the key from
keyserver-options no-honor-keyserver-url

# When searching for a key with --search-keys, include keys that are marked on
# the keyserver as revoked
